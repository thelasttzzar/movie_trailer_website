# movie_trailer_website

A project website for the Udacity Full Stack Developer course showing my 6 favorite movies and displaying information about them, including trailer, poster, and release year.

## The Purpose 

This Python program will gather bits of information about some movies I chose, and output an HTML file. The HTML will display a poster, title, release year, and a short description. When you click on a movie, it will play a trailer from YouTube. 

## Prerequisites

In order to run this program you'll need Python 2.7 or newer. All files should be in the same directory.

## Project Contents

All of these files are required to run the program

* fresh_tomatoes.py - styles, and generates the HTML, JavaScript and CSS that is output
